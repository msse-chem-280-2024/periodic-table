Scientists believed that bismuth was the element with the highest atomic mass whose nuclei do not spontaneously decay. However, in 2003, researchers at the Institut dâ€™Astrophysique Spatiale in Orsay discovered that it is in fact [weakly radioactive](https://www.thebismuthsmith.com/is-bismuth-radioactive-setting-the-record-straight/). The researchers found that bismuth's most common isotope has a half-life of about 1.9*10^19 years, making it virtually stable and thus safe for everyday use.
