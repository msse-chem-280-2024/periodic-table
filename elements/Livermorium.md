Fun Facts:
- Livermorium is an extremely radioactive chemical element that has only been created in a laboratory setting.
- In July 2024, researchers at Berkeley Lab's 88-Inch Cyclotron used a beam of titanium-50 to successfully create superheavy element 116, also known as livermorium. This achievement may allow the team to attempt creating the heaviest element yet, element 120.
- It is a member of the 7th period and is placed in group 16 as the heaviest chalcogen, but it has not been confirmed to behave as the heavier homologue to the chalcogen polonium.
