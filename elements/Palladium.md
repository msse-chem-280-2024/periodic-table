# Facts

1. The U.S. imports about 90 percent of the platinum-group elements it uses, including palladium, according to the USGS.
2. Palladium's most incredible ability is that it can absorb up to 900 times its volume of hydrogen, according to the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. Because of this ability, palladium is used to store and filter hydrogen.
3. Want a long-lasting photograph? Look into platinotyping. This method of photo printing using platinum and palladium salts, which become embedded in the photo paper, according to Tillman Crane photography. Platinotypes are prized for their matte appearance and archival stability â€” as long as the paper remains intact, so will the photograph.
