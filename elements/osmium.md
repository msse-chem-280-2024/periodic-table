Osmium, along with Uranium, was one of the first successful catalysts used in the Haber Process. It is one of the least abundant stable elements, with an average mass of 50 parts per trillion in the earth's crust. Today it is rarely used in its pure state, but can be found used in alloys for high-wear applications, such as in the tips of fountain pens and some types of  electrical contacts.
